# pokemondb


This project was made using the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co) and Java. Of course caching and saving the HTTP Requests and Results would have been much more efficient, but this project was more of a exercise in using APIs and making correct HTTP Requests and Multitasking, etc.

When running the programm the user enters an ID to fetch a Pokemon from the API, my Application shows several key points:


(Independent of Input Generation/Region)

- Name
- ID
- First Generation where the Pokemon was playable
- Types



(Dependent on Input Generation/Region)

- Abilities and the Level where they are learned
- Locations where the Pokemon can be found and catched


POJOs were generated with a Plugin in IntelliJ, but not all POJO Classes were used, the API has so much to offer, one person alone would have a hard time utilizing it to its fullest potential.
